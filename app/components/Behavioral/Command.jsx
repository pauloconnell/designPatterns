            The command pattern is useful in cases when we want to decouple
            objects executing the commands from objects issuing the commands.
            <br />
            For example, imagine a scenario where our application is using a
            large number of API service calls. Then, letâ€™s say that the API
            services change. We would have to modify the code wherever the APIs
            that changed are called. <br />
            <b>
              This would be a great place to implement an abstraction layer,
              which would separate the objects calling an API service from the
              objects which are telling them when to call the API service.
            </b>
            <br /> This way, we avoid modification in all of the places where we
            have a need to call the service, but rather have to{" "}
            <b>change only the objects which are making the call itself</b>,
            which Command pattern dictates is only in one place. <br /> As with
            any other pattern, we have to know when exactly is there a real need
            for such a pattern. We need to be aware of the
            <b>tradeoff we are making</b>, as we are adding an additional
            abstraction layer over the API calls,{" "}
            <b>
              which will reduce performance but potentially save a lot of time
            </b>{" "}
            when we need to modify objects executing the commands.
